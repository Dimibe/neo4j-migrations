# 1.7.0

It's my pleasure to introduce an exciting new feature with this release: The possibility to manage your constraints and indexes for Neo4j in a version agnostic way!

While we took much our inspiration from [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org) in terms of "just use the databases query language", we needed to opt for something different in this case and opted for XML. Much like [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org) did in their beginning:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<migration xmlns="https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations">
    <catalog>
        <constraints>
            <constraint name="unique_isbn" type="unique">
                <label>Book</label>
                <properties>
                    <property>isbn</property>
                </properties>
            </constraint>
        </constraints>
    </catalog>
    
    <verify />
    <create item="unique_isbn"/>
    <create>
            <index name="node_index_name">
                <label>Person</label>
                <properties>
                    <property>surname</property>
                </properties>
            </index>
        </create>
</migration>
```

The structure allows for creating global catalogs that can be build in an iterative way per each migration but also for just doing local creates and drops. All create and drop operations comes per default in an idempotent fashion ("create if not exists" / "drop if exists") regardless of Neo4j version. We make sure to translate the structure above into the Cypher matching your version of Neo4j.

Read more about this in the manual, especially the [concepts](https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations/current/#concepts_catalog) and have look at this [scenario](https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations/current/#usage_defining_asserting_applying_catalogs). There's also a short paragraph why XML is still a good idea in 2022.

This work lays the groundwork of an updated auto-index-manager in [Neo4j-OGM](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm) and - for the first time - a similar solution in [SDN6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j): We will provide annotation processors for both projects later this year creating catalog based migrations.
With that, SDN5+OGM and SDN6 and later users can have both: Constraints and indexes defined by their class model but executed by their process and not by a random start of a random application.

This work would not have been possible without the help of @meistermeier. Thank you.

While we aim for obeying Semver, we just bumped the minor version, even for such a big feature. We want to spare the 2.0 release for the JDK 17 update, also coming later this year. We are able to do so because this change here does not affect you if you don't use it, neither through any of the integrations nor through the API.

Other notable changes in this release are better logging in the CLI (general warnings are now going through stderr for better filtering / pipelining) and also we do now follow symlinks when traversing file based locations.

# 1.5.0

*No breaking changes* but an exciting new feature: have preconditions asserted against your target database before we try to run your refactoring. This way you can make sure you‚Äôll never end up in an invalid state just because Cypher syntax changed in between versions. 

Preconditions we support out of the box:
* Edition check (enterprise or community)
* Version check (enumerated versions or ranges)
* Custom queries returning a boolean value

All preconditions can be asserted (refactoring will stop when unmet) or assumed (single migration will be skipped). 

Have a look at the docs and learn more about [Preconditions](https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations/current/#concepts_preconditions).

# 1.4.0

*No breaking changes*.  The version is bumped due to a couple of new features that required additional API, for example using only remote or locally discovered migrations.

A big "Thank you" goes out to @marianozunino, a long time Neo4j (and Spring Data Neo4j) user, who created his own refactor tooling dubbed [Morpheus](https://github.com/marianozunino/morpheus). We worked together so that this and his tooling use the same meta model. And afterwards, I took some inspiration from the features he had in Morpheus.

The feature I like the most in this release is the new and shiny integration with Quarkus dev-services, check it out: [Dev Services integration](https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations/1.4.0/#devservicesintegration).

## üöÄ Features
- c8f29d4 Add unique constraint for migration nodes on Neo4j 4.4. (#428)
- ed04748 Write and read optional config file from CLI. (#427)
- ad644a5 Add `mode` option to `InfoCmd`.
- b9afdd8 Introduce a ChainBuilderMode to select local or remote chains only. (#425)

# 1.3.0

Happy 2nd birthday, _neo4j-migrations_! ü•≥ The first pre-release, 0.0.1 has been pushed out to central on January 9th, 2020. Since than, stuff has come a long way and I am super happy about it.

1.3.0 is a big release coming only 4 days after the last one [(1.2.3](https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/tag/1.2.3)) and bumping the minor number. Why is that? 
The API hasn't changed in an incompatible way, but there are 2 changes in behavior

1. 2afaaa5 aligns the behavior of the `enabled` flag in the Spring Boot starter with the behavior in the Quarkus extension: A bean of type `Migrations` will be provided in the application context regardless of that setting. You are free to use it any way you want. You might want to make sure your application is on a valid database or not without us applying the migrations. Or you just want to use the `info` api to get the current version
2. c98d757 makes `locations-to-scan` and `packages-to-scan` [Build Time configuration](https://quarkus.io/guides/config-reference#build-time-configuration), meaning they are evaluated at built respectively augmentation time. This allows to finally complete the feature I had on my list since forever [("Add a Quarkus extension")](https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/issues/8) in full: Delivered with c10c4468 in 1.2.2 for the first time, it is now fully supported (and tested) in natively distributed Quarkus applications as well and with that, feature complete. If you want (or need) file based locations outside an augmented application, please use the new `external-locations`. It supports only file-based locations, does not become part of the image and is changeable without re-augmentation.

## üöÄ Features
- 20f27d3 Compress native CLI binaries. (#372)
- b67fcc0 Add `apply` alias for `migrate` to the CLI.
- c98d757 Support classpath scanning in Quarkus native image.
- 2afaaa5 Allow disabling of migrations in Spring Boot without removing the `Migrations` bean. (#361)

## üîÑÔ∏è Refactorings
- ccd6461 Fail early with `classpath://` locations passed to the CLI in native image. (#369)
- 62278f2 Make sure that all sessions handed out use the latest bookmarks known. (#370)
- 3923423 Use transaction functions for all interactions with Neo4j inside the core module. (#365)
- a3422a8 Replace `MigrationsInitializer` in Quarkus extension with ServiceStartBuildItem.
- 4ad5dd0 Use List.sort instead of Collections.

## üìù Documentation
- 6a5ca16 Improve core JavaDocs.

## üõ† Build
- 356fa46 Add end-to-end test for the native CLI. (#371)
- 5ffda5c Use official GraalVM action for releasing. (#366)
- 2c96895 Define a stable order for categories in the changelog.

# 0.3.2

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot.


# 0.3.1

## üöÄ Features

- GH-238 - Add autocrlf option.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix logging on native image.

## üßπ Housekeeping

- GH-239 - Use transaction functions instead of auto commits where applicable.
- Don't print full stacktrace on auth error.
- Set pool size to 1 in CLI. [improvement]
 
Java and native binaries are now published with each GitHub-Release.


# 0.2.1

## üöÄ Features

* GH-237 - Add `validateOnMigrate` to skip validation of migration-checksums.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

* GH-232 - Treat single `\r` as correct line endings.

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot.

Noteworthy: Upgraded the example using Neo4j Test-Harness to Neo4j *4.3.2*. Neo4j requires JDK 11, so this project requires now JDK 11 to **build** but **still targets JDK 8**, so that it can be used with Java 8. I do think that this change in the build justifies a minor version bump alone but we have also a new configuration option, hence the 0.2.1 version.

Thanks to @AndreasBoehme for his input on this release!


# 0.1.4

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot.

* Easier use of the starter: Starter for driver is a non-optional dependency for the starter and stays optional for the auto configuration itself, so that people have choice whether to include it or not.


# 0.0.8

## üöÄ Features

* Spring Boot starter added with instructions

## üö®Api changes

* Renamed prefix `filesystem:` to `file:` to be consistent with most other tools out there. 

*NOTE:* There are 0.0.6 and 0.0.7 on central, but without the starter due to issues with Maven's release plugin, the Nexus plugin and submodules with a different parent. I'm sorry for that.


# 0.0.5

## üöÄ Features

* CLI Module added with instructions


# 0.0.4

## üöÄ Features

* Record execution time
* Full support for multiple databases in Neo4j 4.0
* Convenience methods `MigrationContext#getSession` and `MigrationContext#getSessionConfig` to for session or session config retrieval in Java based migrations
* Add `Migrations#info`, returning a `MigrationChain` containing the state of your database and all discoverable migrations

## üö®Api changes

* Public Core API lives now under `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core`
* Datamodel change: Execution time is now stored as Neo4j `Duration`
* `MigrationType` is an enum now
* `MigrationState` added


# 0.0.3

## üöÄ Features

* Checksums for Cypher script based migrations (stored and validated)

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Turned into multi module project
* Added Checkstyle to the build for making contributions easier
* Decoupled discovery of migrations from the actual migrations


# 0.0.2

## üöÄ Features

* Cypher based migrations
* More information stored on `__Neo4jMigration` nodes and `MIGRATED_TO` relations (description, type, database and system user, possible checksums)

## üö®Api changes

* `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.Migration#apply` takes in a `MigrationContext`, which contains the driver and the migrations configuration and allows for further changes without breaking that API again.
